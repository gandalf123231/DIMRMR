# DIMRMR
In feature selection, distinguishing the redundancy and dependency relationships between features is a challenging task. In recent years, scholars have constantly put forward some solutions, but most of them fail to effectively distinguish dependent features from redundant features. In addition, the influence of feature-relevant complementary item on candidate feature is also ignored, which further reduces the distinguishing ability. In order to improve the distinguishing ability further, the concept of interactive contribution degree is proposed, on which the new discriminant criteria of feature redundancy and dependency are defined. With the discriminant criteria and the feature-relevant complementary item, the dynamic interaction weight is constructed. Then a filter feature selection algorithm DIMRMR is proposed to effectively solve the problem of confusing redundancy and dependency. The experimental results shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve the optimal classification performance on most of the datasets.
